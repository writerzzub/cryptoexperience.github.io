## CRYPTO Experience

I'm one of the fortunate ones when it comes to crypto. Let's just say crypto helped me pay my downpayment on a house.

I've also designed (not launched) an NFT collection and played around and made my own crypto called [HoHoHo](https://bscscan.com/token/0x15298CC571979A3705A16ec008d0Ca1CC4BB1351) or JoseMariChristmas for... yeah... Christmas.
